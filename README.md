2.  Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

Description

Domains: Group of computers that are governed by a security rule(s). Usually group of clients and servers. Computers are once authenticated to a centralized server known as authenticating server, then after they maintain communication without authentication. 

Web servers: Web servers are programs that serve web page to client computer on their request. Usually dedicated computers and appliances are set to serve web request. HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is the most popular file transfer protocol. All computers that serve web page must have the program.

DNS: DNS is a phonebook of the internet. Web address are in human readable format. But computers know these web pages by their IP address. DNS is a list that has web site address in human readable format and IP address format. When an user types a web address then computer uses DNS book to find its IP address and locate the server that holds the requested web page using the IP address. 

Web browser: It is a program that renders HTML, CSS and client side programs and presents data to a user. It helps user to locate, access and display web pages. 

Relationship:
Internet is a collection of large number of Domains in which web servers serve client computer by completing their request using DNS. Information sent by web servers are rendered and presented by web browser. 

Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words).
Continuous Development of web browser has played an important role on how internet has changed our life. Web browser acts as a container to present data in human readable format. 
Machin language are not readable to humans. When we request any information through web browser, the request is processed through layers of protocols, converted into machine readable language and transferred across the networks. Based on the request, web server serves the computer and send information in machine readable language which is processed through the layers of protocols and is displayed in the browser. Following is the picture of layer. By sitting on the top (application) layer, browser renders HTML, CSS, and client side programing language in human readable format and presents it to the user. By this process browser makes web possible for us to interact and use.
